# Hi there, I'm Hanif ðŸ‘‹
This is the place where I get bored with electrical stuff âš¡ and make something fun ðŸŽ‰.<br>
When I'm not coding, I'm probably figuring out how to optimize everythingâ€”except my coffee intake.<br><br>

ðŸ“Œ I'm currently working on something cool:
* ðŸ¤– Learning Machine Learning and AutoCAD
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anythingâ€”I'm always happy to share!
* ðŸŒŸ Fun fact: High voltage may power cities, but coffee powers me!
